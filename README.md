### Steps to Build the Project:

1. Create DynamoDB Table: Set up a DynamoDB table to store and manage application data.

2. Develop Lambda Functions: Implement Lambda functions to handle CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table.

3. Utilize S3 for Static Files: Leverage S3 to store and serve static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the web application.

4. Deploy with CloudFront: Configure a CloudFront distribution to deliver the S3-hosted application with low-latency, high-speed access.

### Expected Outcome:

  Upon completion of this project, you will have:

  A fully functional serverless web application deployed on AWS.

  Hands-on experience integrating AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudFront to build scalable applications.

  Enhanced skills in cloud computing, serverless architecture, and AWS service integration.
